# The Mentor's Solutions

This App will provide you with a list of relevant tickets and knowledgebase articles that you can use as a point of reference when solving the ticket you are currently viewing. You can switch between the Tickets list and Articles list using the navigation at the top of the App.

The App will use an algorithm to choose the search query keywords, based on the Subject and the Description of the ticket currently open and list the results.

It will also use the same search keywords to display a list of related articles from your Knowledgebase.



### The following features are available:

* List of Tickets
* List of Knowledgebase Articles
* View Search Keywords
* Add/Remove Search Keywords
* Ability to filter results using a Custom Dropdown Field (E.g, About Field, Topic, Product Area, etc.)
